# BRImo User Review Analysis - Sentiment Classification and Topic Modeling
This project is part of my undergraduate thesis research. 
It analyzes user reviews of BRI's mobile banking application, BRImo, from the Google Play Store. 
The goal is to understand how users feel about the app (positive or negative sentiment) and identify key themes in the reviews to help improve the app's quality of service.

## Model Used:
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- **Topic Modeling**: Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)
- **Database** : MongoDB Atlas
- **Framework** : Flask

## Results
- **Sentiment Analysis**: The SVM model achieves an outstanding accuracy of 94%, effectively classifying reviews into positive and negative sentiments.
- **Topic Modeling**: LDA identifies 10 topics for the negative class and 9 topics for the positive class, offering insights into the main themes discussed in the reviews.

## Future Works
-Transformers have shown state-of-the-art performance in various NLP tasks, and their application in topic modeling could potentially lead to more accurate and nuanced topic identification.

-Analyze sentiment trends over time: This would involve tracking how sentiment changes over app version releases or timeframes
